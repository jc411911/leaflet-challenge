## Earthquake Data Visualization Map

This project uses **Leaflet.js** to create an interactive map that visualizes earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The map displays earthquake occurrences from the past week, with markers styled according to earthquake magnitude and depth.

## Features

- **USGS Earthquake Data**: Earthquake data is fetched from the USGS GeoJSON feed.
- **Magnitude-based Markers**: Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker, with size proportional to its magnitude.
- **Depth-based Color Coding**: Markers are color-coded based on the earthquake depth.
- **Interactive Popups**: Clicking on a marker provides a popup with the earthquake's location, magnitude, and depth.
- **Legend**: A color-coded legend helps interpret the depth of each earthquake.
